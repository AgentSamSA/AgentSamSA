### Hey everyone! 👋

My name is Samuel, an English graduate-turned-software developer. I'm a hugely creative person who wants to be able to take that creativity into an industry that can utilize it to its fullest extent. I love telling stories and making all kinds of worlds to explore, which hopefully will all be realized into some medium one of these days!
